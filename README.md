# Fixed

A library for reading fixed width / column delimited data files.

## Wishlist of new features

 - Fixed column offsets
 - Error messages for writing operations
 - Strict mode
 - Add an option for padding enum variants to all be the same length
    - Also support shorter than expected lines gracefully
 - Make param list data rather than code to support dynamic lists of
   valid parameters.
 - Allow a function based custom deserialization on individual columns
 - Clear error messages of location of error on read errors
